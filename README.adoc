A demo for using Maven overlays to customize https://nifi.apache.org/[NiFi] UI elements.

Using https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-war-plugin/overlays.html[Maven overlays], you can easily customize https://nifi.apache.org/[NiFi] UI.

In this simple example, only a few icons have been replaced.
But really, all assets can be updated inside nifi-web-ui WAR.

Then, by updating nifi-server-nar using zip, the new assets will be picked up by the NiFi scripts.
